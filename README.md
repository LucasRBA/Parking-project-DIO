###This project was inspired by "Realizando Deploy na Nuvem de um Conjunto de APIâ€™s Desenvolvida em Spring Boot"
####In addition to the base project that aims to serve a parking lot registration system, this implementation has more features, such as:
   - A parking spot generator to remember the user where he/she parked;
   - A license plate generator in order to remove some of the complexity for this test implementation;
   - Some validations to prevent the user not to provide crucial data, like null name and car model.
   
####Feel free to fork and add your own features to the project.
